# Demo17

A simple Spring Boot project to showcase some new language features of Java 17.

- Sealed Classes
- Multiline Strings
- Switch-Pattern Matching

Please note that in order to successfully run the application you need to remove the seal of the abstract classes.
Else hibernate cannot instantiate proxies for the connected entity classes.
